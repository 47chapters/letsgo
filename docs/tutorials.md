## Tutorials

LetsGo has six tutorials in total, and it takes a focused workday to run through all of them.

If you are faster (you are a 10x developer), take off early, beacuse you earned it: you saved yourself or your company a few months of work.

The recommended sequence of the tutorials to follow is this:

[First deployment to AWS](tutorials/first-deployment-to-aws.md)  
[Building and running locally](tutorials/building-and-running-locally.md)  
[Re-deploying to AWS](tutorials/re-deploying-to-aws.md)  
[Setting up authentication with Auth0](tutorials/setting-up-authentication-with-auth0.md)

After that, you can decide what's more important to you:

[Setting up payments with Stripe](tutorials/setting-up-payments-with-stripe.md)  
[Configuring a custom domain](tutorials/configuring-custom-domain.md)

Ready, set, go!
