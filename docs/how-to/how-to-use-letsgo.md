## How to use LetsGo?

LetsGo is organized as a monorepo. Using LetsGo means cloning the repository and then modifying it to implement your own application. In the course of the development, you will be modifying the boilerplate code of the three major components included in the monorepo: the website, the HTTP API, and the worker. You will be also using the devops tool included in the repository to help manage the development lifecycle: deploy the application to AWS, manage production/stage environments, manage configuration, etc.

This is the high level flow of the steps you will follow when working with LetsGo:
